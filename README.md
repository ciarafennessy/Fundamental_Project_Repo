 ### Project Brief: 
 <br>
  This project required us to draw on a wide variety of knowledge and skills. We were expected to imlpement project management both in theory and in practice through the use of project management/progress tracking software (jira in the case of this project). Coding the MVP required technical knowledge of Python, Flask and MySQL. Lastly,an understanding of Git and of Pytest were needed, for mainting a VCS (version control system) and for unit testing the application, respectively. 
 We were expected to work alone, with the exception of some help from an instructor upon request. The application could relate to any theme of our choosing, as long as it satisfied the CRUD criteria and utilised at least two tables with a relationship in a database.

 ### App Design:
  <br>
 I chose to build a recipe application because I am a passionate cook (as you may have seen on my github profile page). It was also one of the first ideas that came to mind when tasked with creating a CRUD app. One can easily picturea website on which a user may upload their own recipes, make ammendments to those recipes, relete recipes and read the recipes of others! Such a web application is relatively easy to imagine, even if you are unsure of the intricate workings behind the scenes, as I was as a newcomer to all of these technologies.

 I started trying to make sense of the aformentioned intricacies by designing an ERD for my database:
