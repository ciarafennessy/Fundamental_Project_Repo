 ### Project Brief: 

 ### App Design:
 <br>
 I chose to build a recipe application because I am a passionate cook (as you may have seen on my github profile page). It was also one of the first ideas that came to mind when tasked with creating a CRUD app. One can easily picturea website on which a user may upload their own recipes, make ammendments to those recipes, relete recipes and read the recipes of others! Such a web application is relatively easy to imagine, even if you are unsure of the intricate workings behind the scenes, as I was as a newcomer to all of these technologies. 
 <br>
 I started trying to make sense of the aformentioned intricacies by designing an ERD for my database.
