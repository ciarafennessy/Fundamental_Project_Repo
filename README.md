 ### Project Brief: 
<br>
This project required us to draw on a wide variety of knowledge and skills. We were expected to imlpement project management both in theory and in practice through the use of project management/progress tracking software (jira in the case of this project). Coding the MVP required technical knowledge of Python, Flask and MySQL. Lastly,an understanding of Git and of Pytest were needed, for mainting a VCS (version control system) and for unit testing the application, respectively. 
<br>
We were expected to work alone, with the exception of some help from an instructor upon request. The application could relate to any theme of our choosing, as long as it satisfied the CRUD criteria and utilised at least two tables with a relationship in a database.
